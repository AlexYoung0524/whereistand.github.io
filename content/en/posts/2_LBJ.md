> Of course, I am only talking about basketball.

I’ve been watching the NBA and CBA since 2001. I was lucky enough to catch the tail end of the Shaq-Kobe era and the legendary battles between Shanghai and Bayi. Those days got me hooked. But lately? As my favorite stars retire and the NBA product starts to smell a bit... off, I’m watching less and less. A huge reason for that is the arrival of the great LeBron James to my beloved LA Lakers, combined with the nauseating "GOAT" propaganda pushed by the "Bronsexuals" (fanboys). This toxic stan culture hasn't just ruined the games; it’s turned every basketball forum into a cesspool. So, I opted out.

However, for the record, I didn’t start out hating the guy. Back in the day, without advanced analytics or 4K film breakdowns, it was hard not to be impressed by the sheer spectacle of young LeBron. During his MVP years, when Shaq was yelling "Win a ring for the King" and the league was hyping up "23 vs. 24," I was actually intrigued. The Cavs were stacked with depth, trading blows with the Lakers. I was genuinely hoping for a Kobe vs. LeBron Finals. I even had this cute little internal conflict: Do I root for my Lakers, or Shaq’s Cavs?

Well, thanks to LeBron’s annual playoff meltdowns, I never had to make that choice. Kobe was the one waiting in the Finals, lifting trophies. And then came "The Decision," which marked the start of the Superteam Era. That was the moment I graduated from a casual observer to a card-carrying, ironclad LeBron Hater.

Recently, haters (or "rational fans," as we prefer) have finally gained some breathing room now that LeBron can’t even stat-pad his way to victories anymore. Plus, with his behavior becoming increasingly contradictory (like his left brain is fighting his right brain), people are finally starting to see him for what he is: a delusional monarch trying to restore a phantom empire. I think it’s time to document exactly why I can’t stand the guy.

Lately, LeBron isn’t satisfied with just playing; he’s launched a podcast, “Mind the Game”. On the surface, it’s about X’s and O’s. In reality, it’s his version of "Bombard the Headquarters": when the "King" can no longer rule with wins, he launches an ideological offensive to rewrite history and cement his status as "Always Correct." It’s not a podcast, it’s a propaganda machine for LeBronism.


## 2003-2010: The "Chosen One" and The Accumulation of Privilege

He entered the league with "The Chosen 1" tattooed on his back before playing a single game. That level of arrogance was unprecedented. The media and Nike were desperate to crown him, acting as if he deserved everything without the struggles ordinary mortals go through. And he ate it up. It perfectly foreshadowed the logic his cult followers would use years later: "Zero rings > Kobe, One ring > Jordan."

A funny side note: Anderson Varejao, the loyal eunuch to the Emperor, once drew "Chosen 2" on his back to please the King. It was a joke then, but ironically, after LeBron ran away in "The Decision," Varejao stayed, improved, and captained the Cavs. When LeBron returned for "The Decision 2.0," LeGM immediately traded him. Turns out, "Chosen 2" had more backbone than the King.

![Chosen 2](/images/posts/LBJ/Chosen_2.png)

His rookie year was controversial, too. Carmelo Anthony took a 17-win Nuggets team to the playoffs in the brutal West (+26 wins). LeBron took a 17-win Cavs team to... a fishing trip in the weak East. Melo had better stats and swept LeBron head-to-head. Yet, LeBron won Rookie of the Year. Why? Maybe the league didn't want to market Melo’s "street" background, or maybe they just saw LeBron’s "desire to progress" (wink wink) as more marketable.

![Anthony](/images/posts/LBJ/LBJ_vs_Anthony.png)

During this era, Team LeBron mastered the art of "Spinning a Funeral into a Wedding." After embarrassing bronze medals in the Olympics, the narrative was always about the teammates or the coaches. It was never him. In 2004, he was a rookie, fine. But in 2006? He was the "leader," playing the most minutes. Yet, this NBA First Teamer averaging 31.4 PPG dropped to 13.9 PPG in FIBA. Meanwhile, Wade and Melo were actually balling.

The game against Greece was a masterclass in low-IQ basketball: 36 seconds left, down 6. A normal player takes a quick 3 and plays defense. LeBron? He drives for a "tough" layup. Misses. Gets his own rebound. Puts it back. 27 seconds left, down 4. Greeks hit free throws. 24 seconds left, down 6. Normal strategy: Quick 3 or foul. LeBron? He drives for a dunk. (The Greeks didn't even defend the 2-pointer). 16 seconds left, down 6. LeBron finally realizes math exists, pulls up for a 3... brick.

Against Argentina in the Bronze Medal game, Wade carried him with 32 points. But with 45 seconds left and the USA up by 15, LeBron decided to treat the fans to a violent dunk. Respect! This brave habit of "stat-padding in garbage time" continues to this day.

Great players change rules (Wilt, Shaq, Barkley). LeBron changed rules too, but in a different way. The league banned hand-checking to clear his runway. They legalized the "Crab Dribble" (traveling) to accommodate his sloppy footwork. The NBA modified the game into "LeBron Ball" to milk his traffic. Seeing the league now suffer from the monster they created is frankly satisfying.

Then came the 2007 Finals, his biggest "carry job" myth. In reality, he rode a weak East conference only to get swept by the Spurs. He averaged 5.8 turnovers, shot 35% from the field, and 20% from three. But it didn't matter. He won the PR war because Duncan told him, "The future is yours."

## 2010-2014: Hostile Takeovers and Revisionist History

"The Decision" in 2010 was the moment the mask slipped.

People say the Celtics Big 3 started the Superteam era. False. The Celtics traded their future and gutted their roster to get Garnett and Allen past their primes. It was a desperate gamble. The Heatles? That was three prime superstars colluding to stack the deck. LeBron strung the Cavs along, preventing them from making moves, then announced his departure on national TV. He left Cleveland like a mining company leaving a stripped quarry. It was scorched earth.

The 2011 Finals was the peak of his "choking artist" career. I love Dirk Nowitzki, but LeBron single-handedly saved Dirk’s legacy. LeBron averaged 17.8 PPG and had that legendary 8-point game, getting clamped by Jason Terry and the 5'10" JJ Barea.

This disaster was pure lack of skill (no post game) and mental weakness. But in the documentaries and podcasts later, they rebranded it as "mental demons" or "finding himself." He even tries to rewrite history now, claiming the Heat weren't a superteam. Bro, your teammates didn't die, you just sucked the life out of them.

LeBron, a high schooler who apparently only reads the first page of books, loves to roleplay as an intellectual. He gave us classics like claiming he loves The Godfather but can't quote a single line, or calling Malcolm X a "very smart man." His arrogance peaked with "Cough-Gate" mocking Dirk’s illness. Dirk responded with a fadeaway in his face. Wade later apologized, but LeBron never did.

![Reading](/images/posts/LBJ/LBJ_Reading.png)

After publicly exposing his inability to play off-ball in 2011, LeBron successfully completed his hostile takeover. He monopolized the ball and demanded a roster constructed solely for his benefit: a legion of shooters to space the floor and defenders whose main job was to wipe his ass on the defensive end. Yes, they beat a baby Thunder team the following year, and then barely scraped by the geriatric Spurs thanks entirely to Chris Bosh’s rebound and Ray Allen’s miracle shot. But the Spurs immediately got their revenge, and their defensive strategy never changed: simply dare LeBron to shoot. During this Heat stint, he didn't just reduce two perennial All-Stars into overqualified role players. He also clashed with authority. He famously bump-checked Coach Spoelstra and tried to pressure Pat Riley into firing Spo so Riley could return to the bench. Unfortunately for LeGM, the Heat are the one franchise built around their culture, not a player’s ego. His little coup failed miserably.

![Bump](/images/posts/LBJ/LBJ_Bump_Spoelstra.png)

Then, after losing the Finals, just when everyone wanted to strengthen the roster, build chemistry, and run it back for another year, LeBron fled again. His exit was just as cowardly and shameful as "The Decision." When Dwyane Wade voluntarily opted out of his contract and took a $10 million pay cut just to keep him, LeBron knew exactly what he was doing but stayed silent. He secretly back-channeled with the Cavaliers and, while keeping everyone in the dark, left under the banner of "Coming Home." The Heat management, Wade, and Bosh were completely blindsided. They never dreamed that a "brother" they fought alongside yesterday would turn them into disposable assets overnight just to clear cap space for younger stars like Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love.

## 2014-2018: Game of Thrones, Purges, and Media Hegemony

In 2014, after releasing that fake "I'm Coming Home" PR statement about "hometown basketball," the real palace coup began. The prerequisite for LeBron’s return was for owner Dan Gilbert to write an apology letter and unconditionally pay the luxury tax. He used short-term "1+1" contracts to hold the franchise hostage, forcing management to mortgage future draft picks for "win-now" players. He consumed resources like a swarm of locusts, fishing for fame without caring about the aftermath. Many LeBron fans love to praise these "1+1" deals as a sign of his confidence and power. But let’s flip the logic. Because you created such massive uncertainty, and because you had already backstabbed your teams twice, it is perfectly normal that the franchise dared not go "all-in" on the future. Unfortunately, the Cavs owner caved and did it anyway.

![I'm Coming Home](/images/posts/LBJ/Im_Coming_Home.png)

Regarding the construction of "Cavs 2.0," LeBron simply copy-pasted the Heat model: an assassin-type scorer (Wade/Kyrie), a spacing big man (Bosh/Love), plus a swarm of shooters and 3-and-D players. LeBron quickly squandered the assets Cleveland had accumulated over four years. In the 2015 Finals, they met the rising Warriors. Andre Iguodala’s FMVP was certainly controversial, but the voters’ logic was essentially "Anyone but Curry." Ironically, this fueled another LeBron myth: "Whoever guards me becomes FMVP," effectively giving himself credit even when he loses.

No Finals series in history has been more divisive or controversial than 2016. It was so controversial that years later, even former Cavs players admitted the league rigged it to ensure a Cavs comeback. I don't think we have ever seen such a spectacle in the long river of NBA history, not even the 2006 Heat vs Mavs or the 2002 Lakers vs Kings. The instigator, of course, was LeBron. The most famous incident was his step-over on Draymond Green, followed by his post-game snitching to the league office to get Green retroactively assessed a flagrant foul and suspended. When even his own teammates thought they couldn't win, he tirelessly used his on-court privilege to rough up Warriors players, grabbing, pulling, and pushing mid-air. He even utilized various sliding tackles on Curry. Finally, he gained the mercy of "God" (the league and the refs). Down 1-3, they suspended Green for Game 5, fouled out Curry in Game 6 with phantom touch fouls, and in Game 7, with the Warriors' interior defense injured, Kyrie Irving hit the three that killed the game. They won this ugly Finals. And yet, the player who actually killed the game received exactly zero votes for FMVP. LeBron continued his record of never losing a vote.

![Green](/images/posts/LBJ/LBJ_Green.png)

After winning this comeback, which was historic enough to be recorded in the annals of time, LeBron’s pettiness resurfaced. At the victory party, he served cookies shaped like tombstones to mock the Golden State Warriors.

![Cake](/images/posts/LBJ/LBJ_Cake.png)

But eventually, karma hit LeBron. A prime MVP, who had suffered deeply from the "Decision 1" superteam era, chose to enter free agency and parachute into the Golden State Warriors. From that moment on, Curry got his best "Reaper's Scythe." This Warriors team now possessed the ability to secure victory firmly, even when playing 5 against 8.

The backlash, or rather the boomerang effect of Cavs 2.0, clearly didn't end there. After losing to the Warriors in the 2017 Finals, LeBron’s camp plotted to trade Kyrie Irving for Paul George. At the time, everyone knew LeBron was the "General Manager," so nobody doubted he would trade anyone to upgrade the roster. The Cavs insiders were already living in fear. But the lowest thing LeBron did was leak the news early. He controlled the media narrative to paint Kyrie as a traitor, attempting to "incite the masses to fight the masses," trying to get a bargain while acting innocent. However, Kyrie was not Wade. He would not let LeBron bully him. Although LeBron treated Kyrie as the "Crown Prince" throughout the Cavs 2.0 era, Kyrie, a disciple of Kobe, forced a trade directly. He turned Boston into his own fortress. LeBron and the Cavs did not get the Paul George they dreamed of, and Kyrie’s departure undoubtedly threw the last shovel of dirt on the crumbling LeBron-Cavs dynasty.

Yet, you cannot say the 2017-2018 Cavs roster wasn't luxurious. At the start of the season, they had the 2nd best odds to win the title and were 1st in the East. The opening roster included LeBron, Kevin Love, JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, Isaiah Thomas, Dwyane Wade, Derrick Rose, Jae Crowder, Iman Shumpert, Channing Frye, Kyle Korver, Jeff Green, and Jose Calderon. 

By the trade deadline, they upgraded the roster to LeBron, Love, JR, TT, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood, George Hill, Larry Nance Jr., Korver, Jeff Green, and Calderon. The result? They finished 4th in a weak Eastern Conference. 

In the first round, they struggled to a 4-3 win against Oladipo’s Pacers. In the second round, they met the only star LeBron has ever truly dominated, DeRozan, and swept him. In the Eastern Finals, they barely scraped by a rookie Jayson Tatum and a sophomore Jaylen Brown 4-3. Achieving such a record with such a roster against such opponents was blown up as the "2018 Peak Thanos LeBron." If Thanos knew he struggled back and forth against ten thousand Wakandan foot soldiers, he would have died of embarrassment.


## 2018-Present: The Great Leap Forward in Stats & The Governance of a Thug

After successfully grinding the "Max Level Account" of the Cavaliers into ruins again after the 2018 season, LeBron came up with a new excuse: "School District Basketball." Under the guise of his children’s education in Southern California, he joined the Los Angeles Lakers as a free agent. For the second time, he left the Cleveland Cavaliers with a mess of garbage contracts and no future draft picks.

Upon joining, LeBron’s slogan was all about teaching the Lakers' young talent how to win. As expected, in his first year, he failed to lead the team to the playoffs. The team was quickly shrouded in the dark cloud of rumors that the Lakers wanted to trade all the young players for Anthony Davis.

![Youths](/images/posts/LBJ/LBJ_Lakers_Youth.png)

The biggest joke of that year was LeBron announcing he had activated "Playoff Mode," only to lead the team to a 3-12 record and completely miss the postseason.

![Playoff Mode](/images/posts/LBJ/LBJ_Playoff_Mode.png)

In the 2019 offseason, the Lakers indeed paid almost all their young assets to get Anthony Davis. When AD arrived, LeBron promised this would be "AD’s team." Inside the Bubble, AD put up the best performance of his career, killing it in the series against Denver and Miami, even hitting a buzzer-beating game-winner. However, under LeBron’s manipulation, AD received zero votes for FMVP. LeBron continued to harvest all the voted honors for himself.

In the 2021 playoffs, LeBron lived up to expectations, continuing his routine of being soft and quitting on plays early. In the 2021 offseason, ignoring management's desire to acquire DeMar DeRozan, LeBron specifically demanded a trade for Russell Westbrook, who had just led a team to the playoffs. He also recruited Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Rajon Rondo, and Malik Monk, forming a luxury team with four "NBA 75" members. However, under LeBron’s leadership, this team finished 11th and didn't even make the play-in tournament. It is worth mentioning that this team had the second-highest odds to win the title at the start of the season, meaning the public was very bullish. But we all know the result: Westbrook became the sole, perfect scapegoat. He suffered two years of verbal abuse before finally getting his wish to leave that cesspool.

If previous team-ups were just "business mergers," then Bronny’s entry in 2024 completely tore off the last fig leaf of competitive sports, dragging the NBA back to a feudal caste system.

Even though Bronny’s college stats were so dismal he wouldn't even count as an import player in the CBA, he secured a formal roster spot on the Lakers purely because of his noble surname. LeBron used his actions to tell the world: Hard work is optional, but having the right reincarnation is mandatory. This is the loudest slap in the face to the "American Dream," yet the most affectionate confession to "Patriarchy." To ensure the Crown Prince takes over smoothly, the Lakers even hired JJ Redick, a man with zero coaching experience and LeBron’s podcast partner, as the head coach. Now, he has the gun (the ball), the pen (public opinion), and even the Organization Department (the coaching staff) is all his own people.

LeBron has never stopped chasing championships. But when a real championship drifted further away and he couldn't win a "real ring," he keenly seized upon a "Spiritual Civilization Award" created by the league: the In-Season Tournament Champion. He solemnly raised a banner for it. Rondo once said that for the Celtics, anything short of a championship is a failure, and they don't hang banners for conference titles. I even feel that the Lakers, as the Celtics' arch-rival, have brought shame to Boston by doing this.

As LeBron’s cumulative stats go higher and higher, his goal has shifted to the so-called "Project 40k-10k-10k." He fights harder in garbage time, caring nothing about winning or defense, only about things related to his core stats. In the world of LeBron fans and LeBron’s media, as long as he completes this earth-shattering Project 40k-10k-10k, he is the undisputed greatest of all time.

While LeBron repeatedly crowns himself, earnestly educating everyone that "You must respect me" and "I deserve to be number one on everyone's list," he gets humiliated time and time again. By the "Who's your daddy" chants in Denver, by the "LeBron's gonna trade you" chants in Indiana, and even by "Let's go Heat" chants at the Lakers' home court.

![No 1](/images/posts/LBJ/LBJ_1_of_the_list.png)

This doesn't even count the heartbreaking details, like the Heat celebrating their 13th anniversary of reaching the Finals with a photo that didn't include LeBron, or the Cavs not even saving a minimum contract slot for him when he wanted to return.

![Heat](/images/posts/LBJ/Maimi_Heat_Post.png)

But never has there been a franchise leader, let alone a self-proclaimed GOAT, who has the face to throw a tantrum like the Monkey King bursting from the stone during a regular season game. He staged the "Shocking Kneel" at TD Garden, refusing to get up for a long time after an unfair call. There is no other player who kneels on one knee to beg referees for a whistle. How can a man who considers it a loss if he doesn't gain an advantage be a leader or the greatest of all time?

![Kneel1](/images/posts/LBJ/LBJ_Kneel1.png)

## Conclusion: The "Always Correct" Core

Looking at LeBron's career, he has constructed a perfect closed loop:

- **Control the Media (Klutch Sports, ESPN)**: Only praise is allowed, dissent is forbidden. Otherwise, people like Paul Pierce or Michelle Beadle get purged.

- **Modify the Rules**: Traveling, verticality rules... the rules are tools to serve me.

- **Purge Allies**: Wade, Bosh, Kyrie, Love, Westbrook, AD... brothers when useful, disposable assets (consumables) when not.

- **Stat Deification**: Using accumulated, watered-down stats (Project 40k-10k-10k) to counter real win rates and championships.

- **Extreme Hypocrisy**: Left brain contradicts the right brain, zero integrity. He uses his on-court privilege to personally dismantle countless players and stars.

- **Glory Hog**: Personal stats, honors, praise, respect, status... he wants it all. He will maximize personal glory even at the expense of team victory. "If it's a championship without FMVP, I'd rather not have it."

LeBron has established a "Pseudo-Dynasty" full of lies, double standards, and privilege on the originally pure land of sports competition. The NBA league office, various team managements, and retired players who have aided this tyrant for years are finally waking up and starting to set things right. I don't think ordinary viewers suddenly became "righteous." It is simply because the one result that legitimized LeBron’s core narrative—"Winning"—is gone. The ordinary fans, who were brainwashed by LeBron for years, followed the logic he instilled in them: if you lose, you must find someone to blame. After losing year after year, and changing teammates round after round, they finally realized that the only person who hasn't changed is the problem itself. I don't think LeBron is inherently evil. He is just not that good. It was the era and coincidence that placed him at a height he shouldn't have occupied. But I won't sympathize with him. Who would refuse to stomp on him ten thousand times after he falls? Just like he encouraged others to do to countless teammates and opponents.

LeBron uses his career achievements to tell the world one thing: As long as you control the microphone, have thick enough skin, know how to rewrite history, and learn how to invert black and white, you can declare that you have achieved a "Great Victory" in a war full of defeats.
