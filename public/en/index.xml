    <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Of course, I am only talking about basketball.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve been watching the NBA and CBA since 2001. I was lucky enough to catch the tail end of the Shaq-Kobe era and the legendary battles between Shanghai and Bayi. Those days got me hooked. But lately? As my favorite stars retire and the NBA product starts to smell a bit&hellip; off, I’m watching less and less. A huge reason for that is the arrival of the great LeBron James to my beloved LA Lakers, combined with the nauseating &ldquo;GOAT&rdquo; propaganda pushed by the &ldquo;Bronsexuals&rdquo; (fanboys). This toxic stan culture hasn&rsquo;t just ruined the games; it’s turned every basketball forum into a cesspool. So, I opted out.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>My fascination with jazz started with a story about fake books. The first time I heard the phrase “fake book,” the image that popped into my head was a book whose cover says, “Don’t look, it’s fake.” Later I learned it was something completely different.</p>
<p>Its “fake” does not mean counterfeit. It means pretending. You can think of a fake book as a lifesaving crib sheet. It usually is not a full score, but a single melody line plus chord symbols, sometimes with lyrics. The purpose is almost embarrassingly practical. Tonight you are playing a regular gig in a bar, a dance hall, or a restaurant. The audience requests songs the way they order dishes, and they do it with an impressive level of confidence. You cannot possibly memorize everything, and you cannot haul a cart of sheet music everywhere you go. So what do you do. You bring a fake book. You flip to the tune. The melody and the harmonic skeleton are there. The rest is on you.</p>]]></description>
