    <description><![CDATA[<p>My fascination with jazz started with a story about fake books. The first time I heard the phrase “fake book,” the image that popped into my head was a book whose cover says, “Don’t look, it’s fake.” Later I learned it was something completely different.</p>
<p>Its “fake” does not mean counterfeit. It means pretending. You can think of a fake book as a lifesaving crib sheet. It usually is not a full score, but a single melody line plus chord symbols, sometimes with lyrics. The purpose is almost embarrassingly practical. Tonight you are playing a regular gig in a bar, a dance hall, or a restaurant. The audience requests songs the way they order dishes, and they do it with an impressive level of confidence. You cannot possibly memorize everything, and you cannot haul a cart of sheet music everywhere you go. So what do you do. You bring a fake book. You flip to the tune. The melody and the harmonic skeleton are there. The rest is on you.</p>]]></description>
